## Variables, referenses and mutability

### Mutable vs. Immutable Objects

“Not all objects are created equal”

There are two kinds of objects in Python: Mutable objects and Immutable objects. The value of a mutable object can be modified in place after it’s
creation, while the value of an immutable object cannot be changed.

* **Immutable** Object: int, float, long, complex, string tuple, bool

* **Mutable** Object: list, dict, set, byte array, user-defined classes
